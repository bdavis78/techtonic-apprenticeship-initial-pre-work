        <h2> A Brief History</h2>
           <p> Farrah was found by friends of mine and my husbands. 
            Her collar got caught on thier fence and her previous owners had no interest in getting her back.
            We believe that she had been abused or traumatized in some way as she didn't want to be touched at first and would bite and scratch us when we tried.
            However, we gave her a safe space, let her come to us, never got mad at her when she lashed out and gave her lots of love. 
            Now although she is still nervous about strangers and doesn't like to be picked up, she loves to cuddle and get affection.
            She trusts us and has become a part of a loving family.
            She was named after we discovered that she had an obsession with drinking directly from the faucet.</p>
